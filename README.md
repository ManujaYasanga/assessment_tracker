### Assessment Tracker

This is an application built with Flutter and Firebase, developed as an experiment. Through this project, I learned how to manage data, authenticate users, store and synchronize data both online and offline, and manage the state of an app. Finally, I successfully built the APK version of my app.

I used the following technologies to develop and implement my features:

- **Firebase Authentication**: To authenticate users.
- **Cloud Firestore**: To store and manage data.
- **GetX**: To manage the state of the app and handle navigation.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience with these powerful tools and frameworks, enhancing my skills in mobile app development.
